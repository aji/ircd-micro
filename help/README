Information on the helpfile format

This is a quick primer on the help file format - how it works, its limitations,
and rationale behind certain decisions.

Please note that files that do not follow this format will be summarily
rejected by ircd-micro upstream for inclusion.

This document is covered under the WTFPL version 2.


1) Opers or users?

The first question you must ask yourself is who should see the given help file.
Will it benefit end users, or is it of primary benefit to opers? This is what
the opers/ and users/ subdirectories are for.

Files contained within opers/ will only ever be seen by opers - they will
override anything in users/.

On the other hand, users/ will only ever be seen by users. Any files in opers/
not in users/ will be ignored if the user is not an oper and the help file will
be reported as not found.


2) Basic format

The format is outlined as follows (leading spaces for clarity):

<example>
  HELP_FILE [params] <params>

  This is an example help file.

  Boxes should be delinated like so:

  col1  | col2
  ------+--------------------------------
  item1 | stuff for item 1
  ------+--------------------------------
  item2 | stuff for item 2, if it wraps
        | then make another line.
  ------+--------------------------------
        | If you have a line that spans
  item3 | more than 3 lines, then centre
	| the item name.
  ------+--------------------------------

</example>

Non-ASCII characters are not allowed in upstream ircd-micro help files
except for possible future localisations. This also means English-only,
please!

Colour codes are prohibited in upstream ircd-micro files, except bold and
underline; however, try to keep these to a minimum (preferably not at all).

Keep each line at 60 chars or under. 80 is the hard limit - you'll do
well to stay clear of it. Beyond 80 characters, lines *WILL* be cut off
*BY DESIGN.* ircd-micro will not change this hard limit; in addition,
ircd-micro upstream will reject files exceeding the 60 character limit
unless a clearly defined rationale is attached.


3) First line

The first line of the help file is special - it will be sent with its own
numeric and may be presented differently to users. There is no expected format,
but it must follow the conventions in existing help files to be included in
ircd-micro.

Required parameters must be in angle brackets. Optional ones must be in square
brackets. Multiple selections can be delineated with curly brackets and commas.
It is permissible to nest these structures.

No opening line should be greater than 60 characters. The maximum hard limit

Examples include:

NICK <nickname>
MODE <channel> :<+|-><modes> [parameters]


3) Body

The body is sent as normal. Blank lines will have padding added to them for
client formatting purposes upon sending. Please try to follow the conventions
outlined above for body text.


4) Conclusion

Whilst it may seem these rules are arbitrary and annoying, they do in fact
improve the usability of ircd-micro. 60 characters are imposed to maintain
comfortable reading, especially on narrow terminals. Colour codes are eschewed
to maintain similar readability. Boxes are in a standard format for a uniform,
easy-to-read look.

Happy hacking!
