/* abort_upgrade
 * -------------
 * In the event that restore fails, we re-execute ourself in non-upgrade mode.
 * One could design the restore system to be transactional, but that creates a
 * much greater degree of complexity. The objective of this system is to be
 * simple and maintainable. Strange though double-exec may be, it's a simple
 * and effective failsafe. Since the upgrade dump is written and read by (more
 * or less) the same code, failures really shouldn't happen. But in the
 * unlikely event that that does happen, we can at least continue operation
 * and accept new connections rather than simply crash.
 *
 * This means that the restore_ functions leak memory and result in undefined
 * state on failure. The program must exit when this occurs. This is comparable
 * to the init_ functions, so it matches the style of ircd-micro.
 *
 * Proper error handling is retained for the '_from_json' functions at this
 * time, since there is no clear motive to remove it.
